# Weekend Links and Readings

Yesterday had a great session where I learned a lot about using git, and use of software like the peerJ and [figshare](http://www.figshare.com) for storing of files. In this post I present a workflow that just may work

## What may Work

All scholarly articles, academic notes, etc go into figshare and all of them are filed with the github as github is one stop repository that can be relied on. Plus all goes into figshare for storage. Plus a lot of them will go into the institutional repository.

Right now I am working with the meta analysis. The stata files and the R files for the work can eminently be written and worked up in the atom editor and be prepared for the github and the figshare system. The internal computer based work can be done with Scrivener. All web based work can be done here (in this editor and shared with the ftp and other access)

I also have an access to the [draft](http://www.draftin.com) writing system that works very well with most complex writing and essays and other stuff. Draft plays very well with a range of writing environments including bibdesk. Markdown and bibdesk[1] is certainly the way to go as far as I see it.

For presentations I am going to use deck.js or reveal.js. Excellent stuff for putting together presentations for classwork. Needs a bit of tweaking but can be done. The advantage being the slides can be stored in github and then linked from github directly for people to view them on their browsers. Plus figshare can directly import them from github.

## Can draft play well with git?

Point to explore.

Basically, with git, atom, and markdown, writing and storing school work is essentially a one stop solution, as everything can be sweetly synchronized.
