## Suffering with Github

After struggling for two days, I am going to give up on github for project related neat blogging ar updates. It does not work, it is not intuitive, the jekyll templating system (whatever) is a piece of crap!

I am moving over to other blogging platforms for work. This will remain mostly for dead file hosting, till they find something easier for us to configure and use!

Damn!
