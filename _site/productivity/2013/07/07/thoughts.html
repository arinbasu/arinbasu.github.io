      <a href="/2013/07/14/bigdata.html">Big Data</a>
      <p> Came across this very interesting article on big data mining that argues that while big data is great for business intelligence such as positioning of brands (say cereals) before a snowstorm, their assumptions that correlation == causation is a problematic one. By the same token, when you take big data in healthcare and analyze, these should  not necessarily have connotations for health policy setting, as for policy you necessarily have to have a notion of cause and effect association. The other issue around that problem is the role of small numbers versus large numbers and the purpose for which these data are collected.

<p>All of this weekend, I struggled with the idea of putting together a workable solution to put ideas integrating everything to be done as simple as possible over web, and no simpler. The friends in the process are tools that we can use (I think):</p>

<ol>
<li>Use markdown for writing posts in Scrivener</li>

<li>Use sketchnotes (more on that later) and scapple for putting together ideas</li>

<li>Use git for hosting the files with Jekyll</li>

<li>Use Moodle (at the University of Canterbury we use something known as Learn) to show it to students</li>
</ol>
